User authentication data flows through secure channels, with credentials being validated against the user database and JWT tokens being generated for session management. The authentication flow includes multiple security layers including password hashing, token expiration, and secure cookie handling. OAuth integration with Google provides an additional authentication method, enhancing user convenience while maintaining security standards.

Machine learning data flow involves the collection of historical stock data, feature engineering to create technical indicators, and model training to generate predictions. The prediction flow processes user requests for stock forecasts, retrieves relevant historical data, applies the trained machine learning model, and returns results with confidence scores. This flow includes data preprocessing, model inference, and result validation to ensure prediction accuracy.

The sorting algorithm data flow handles user requests for stock data organization, implementing various sorting algorithms based on user preferences. This flow processes stock datasets, applies the selected sorting algorithm, and returns organized results with performance metrics. The system supports multiple sorting criteria including price, volume, market cap, and technical indicators, providing users with flexible data organization options.

3.4 System Architecture Design

The system architecture design implements a layered approach that promotes separation of concerns and enables independent development and testing of system components. The presentation layer handles all user interface interactions, implementing responsive design principles and real-time data updates. This layer communicates with the business logic layer through well-defined API contracts, ensuring loose coupling between frontend and backend components.

The business logic layer contains the core application functionality including user management, stock data processing, machine learning algorithms, and sorting implementations. This layer implements the application's core business rules and coordinates between different system components. The business logic layer also handles external API integrations, data validation, and error handling, providing a robust foundation for the application's functionality.

The data access layer manages all database operations and external API communications. This layer implements data abstraction patterns that hide the complexity of data storage and retrieval from the business logic layer. The data access layer includes connection pooling, query optimization, and caching mechanisms to ensure optimal performance. External API integrations are handled through dedicated service classes that implement retry logic, error handling, and data transformation.

The infrastructure layer provides cross-cutting concerns such as logging, monitoring, security, and configuration management. This layer implements middleware components that can be applied across different parts of the system, ensuring consistent behavior and reducing code duplication. The infrastructure layer also handles system configuration, environment-specific settings, and deployment considerations.

3.5 Database Design

The database design implements a normalized relational structure that efficiently stores and retrieves financial data while maintaining data integrity and performance. The stocks table serves as the central entity, storing basic information about publicly traded companies including symbol, company name, sector, and market capitalization. This table establishes the foundation for all other data relationships and serves as the primary reference for stock identification.

The historical_data table stores daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for each stock, enabling technical analysis and machine learning model training. This table implements efficient indexing strategies to support fast queries for specific date ranges and stock combinations. The table structure supports both real-time data updates and historical data analysis, with optimized storage for large datasets.

The predictions table stores machine learning model outputs, including predicted prices, confidence scores, and algorithm metadata. This table enables users to track prediction accuracy over time and provides historical context for current predictions. The table design supports multiple prediction types and algorithms, allowing for future expansion of machine learning capabilities.

The users table manages user authentication and profile information, implementing secure password storage and role-based access control. This table supports both traditional username/password authentication and OAuth integration, providing flexibility in user authentication methods. The table structure includes audit fields for tracking user activity and maintaining security compliance.

The watchlist table implements user preferences for stock monitoring, enabling personalized dashboard experiences and notification systems. This table maintains many-to-many relationships between users and stocks, supporting efficient queries for user-specific data. The table design includes timestamp fields for tracking when stocks were added to watchlists and enabling automatic cleanup of inactive entries.

3.6 User Interface Design

The user interface design emphasizes usability, accessibility, and professional appearance suitable for financial applications. The design follows modern web design principles including responsive layouts, intuitive navigation, and consistent visual hierarchy. The black and white color scheme provides a professional appearance while ensuring good contrast and readability across different devices and lighting conditions.

The layout organizes information hierarchically, with the most important data displayed prominently and secondary information accessible through expandable sections.

The prediction interface guides users through the process of generating stock price forecasts, providing clear explanations of the machine learning process and confidence scoring. The interface includes progress indicators for model training and prediction generation, ensuring users understand the system's current status. Results are presented with clear visualizations and explanatory text, helping users interpret prediction outcomes.

The sorting interface provides users with multiple options for organizing stock data according to their preferences. The interface includes algorithm selection controls, performance metrics display, and result visualization tools. Users can compare different sorting algorithms and understand their performance characteristics, enabling informed decision-making about data organization strategies.

3.7 Security Design

The security design implements multiple layers of protection to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user data and system operations. Authentication security includes JWT token-based session management with configurable expiration times and secure token storage.

Authorization security implements role-based access control, with different permission levels for regular users, premium users, and administrators. The system enforces access controls at both the API level and the user interface level, ensuring that users can only access features and data appropriate to their account type. API security includes rate limiting, input validation, and SQL injection prevention to protect against common web application vulnerabilities.

Data security implements encryption for sensitive information and secure transmission protocols for all data communications. The system uses HTTPS for all web communications and implements secure cookie handling for session management. Database security includes connection encryption, query parameterization, and access logging to prevent unauthorized data access and maintain audit trails.

Session security implements automatic logout mechanisms, concurrent session limits, and secure session storage to prevent session hijacking and unauthorized access. The system monitors for suspicious activity patterns and implements automatic security measures such as account lockouts and IP blocking when potential threats are detected.

3.8 Performance Design

The performance design focuses on optimizing system responsiveness and throughput while maintaining reliability and scalability. Database performance optimization includes strategic indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling to ensure fast data access. The system implements caching strategies at multiple levels, including database query caching, API response caching, and frontend data caching to reduce response times for frequently requested information.

API performance optimization includes asynchronous processing for time-consuming operations, request batching for multiple data requests, and response compression to reduce bandwidth usage. The system implements load balancing and horizontal scaling capabilities to handle increased user loads without performance degradation. Machine learning performance optimization includes model caching, feature precomputation, and parallel processing to ensure prediction requests are handled efficiently.

Frontend performance optimization includes code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient state management to ensure smooth user interactions. The system implements progressive loading strategies that display critical information immediately while loading additional details in the background. Real-time updates are optimized to minimize unnecessary re-renders and maintain smooth user experience during data updates.

Monitoring and alerting systems track performance metrics including response times, error rates, and resource utilization to identify potential performance issues before they impact users.
