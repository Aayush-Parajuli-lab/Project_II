# 🚀 React App Fixes - StockVision Pro

## ✅ Problem Solved: Blank Screen Issue

Your React app was showing a blank screen due to several issues that have now been **completely fixed**!

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Bootstrap CSS Import Error**
- **Problem:** `frontend/src/index.js` was importing Bootstrap CSS which we removed
- **Fix:** Removed the `import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";` line

### 2. **Tailwind CSS Directives**
- **Problem:** `frontend/src/index.css` still had Tailwind directives
- **Fix:** Replaced with clean CSS reset and Inter font import

### 3. **React Router Nesting Issue**
- **Problem:** `BrowserRouter` was declared both in `index.js` and `App.js`
- **Fix:** Removed the nested `Router` component from `App.js`

### 4. **Missing Welcome Page**
- **Problem:** App loaded directly to StockList which needs backend data
- **Fix:** Created beautiful Welcome component as the landing page

## ✨ New Features Added
